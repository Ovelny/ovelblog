        <h2>About deep work</h2>
      <p>Deep work is a term used to describe what happens when an individual gets absorbed and intensely focused on a challenging enough task. This workflow is usually the best for your productivity and should be reached whenever possible.</p>

<p><a href="https://azeria-labs.com/the-importance-of-deep-work-the-30-hour-method-for-learning-a-new-skill/" rel="nofollow">Azeria&#39;s article on deep work</a></p>

<p>As seen in the article, several ways are possible to develop a deep work habit, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Monastic: “This philosophy attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations.” — isolate yourself for long periods of time without distractions; no shallow work allowed.</li>
<li>Bimodal: “This philosophy asks that you divide your time, dedicating some clearly defined stretches to deep pursuits and leaving the rest open to everything else.” – dedicate a few consecutive days (like weekends, or a Sunday, for example) for deep work only, at least one day a week.</li>
<li>Rhythmic: “This philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit.” – create a daily habit of three to four hours every day to perform deep work on your project.</li>
<li>Journalistic: “in which you fit deep work wherever you can into your schedule.” — Not recommended to try out first, since you first need to accustom yourself to deep work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some are more interesting than the others: rhythmic and bimodal seem to fit better into our busy lives for example.</p>

<p>Azeria recommends the following schedule :</p>

<ul>
<li>pick a skill or subject of interest that you wish to learn</li>
<li>practice it for 30 hours of deep work</li>
<li>split the 30 hours into seven 4-hour sessions, including buffer time</li>
<li>Do 2 sessions per week to be done in 3 weeks</li>
</ul>

<p>This plan is made to select and try a new skill to see if it would be an useful one for your career. After you&#39;ve done your 30 hours, you&#39;ll have a clear idea about the topic and whether or not you should continue practicing it.</p>
