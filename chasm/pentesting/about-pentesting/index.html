        <h2>About pentesting</h2>
      <p>Pentesting, or Penetration Testing, is the process of identifying weaknesses and vulnerabilities in software and systems. Companies employ pentesters in order to discover their own vulnerabilities and secure their assets.</p>

<p>A penetration testing is not a complete security audit: it is only a part of it. In essence, the role of a pentester is to emulate the digital adversaries of a company. That is why it is often said that you need to think like an attacker, or even a criminal to succeed in this field.</p>

<p>Every penetration test begins with a written agreement between you and the client. In this agreement, you will often find the pentest&#39;s scope (what you can and cannot test) and the objectives (why a test is being conducted).</p>

<p>Keep in mind that without any agreement, conducting a pentest is a criminal offense.</p>

<h2>The rules of engagement</h2>

<p>The rules of engagement define how things will be tested within the scope&#39;s boundaries. For instance, it can specify that you are not allowed to view the contents of a specific database, even if you have to assess its security. It also defines when you can conduct your tests. A company might need you outside of office hours, or whenever it is convenient for them to have you pentest their systems.</p>

<h2>The report</h2>

<p>The pentest report is the most important document that you will provide to the company once your tests are done. It contains every detail about any vulnerabilites found, and the steps needed to fix them for the IT staff of the company.</p>

<h2>Black, grey, and white box testing</h2>

<p>Black, grey, and white box testing are ways of defining different kinds of pentest. They are different about their respective starting points and prior knowledge given to the pentester.</p>

<h3>Black box testing</h3>

<p>A black box penetration test means that the pentester will know nothing about the company, except for its name. As such, it requires a lot of information gathering to conduct it, and emulates closely what a real hacker might do and try in the outside world.</p>

<h3>Grey box testing</h3>

<p>A grey box penetration test is a middle ground between black box and white box: the pentester will be provided some specific information about the company, or even some credentials to increase the attack surface (the possible ways of compromising a system).</p>

<h3>White box testing</h3>

<p>A white box penetration test will give all details of the company&#39;s internal structure, infrastructure and application. It is the least likely to emulate the behavior of a real threat, but it can enable more rigorous testing since no time is spent doing information gathering.</p>
