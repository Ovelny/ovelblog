        <h2>Penetration testing phases</h2>
      <p>A pentest very often consists of similar phases, done in the following order.</p>

<h2>Information gathering</h2>

<p>The first step of a pentest is to gather information. It is the most important part because the more time you spend on it, the more your attack surface will increase.</p>

<p>There is a distinction between passive and active information gathering. Passive information gathering consists of gaining information with indirect means, like searching about the company online or gathering registration information.</p>

<p>Active information gathering refers to all the information you can collect by interacting with the company&#39;s infrastructure and services, like scanning their open ports.</p>

<h2>Vulnerability identification</h2>

<p>Vulnerability identification is the process of identifying potential vulnerabilities with data you collected from information gathering. It is also the process of quantifying and prioritizing them, which is also called vulnerability assessment.</p>

<p>It can be done either manually or automatically.</p>

<h2>Exploitation</h2>

<p>Exploitation is the practical side of a pentest. It consists of using the vulnerabilities you identified to your advantage, in order to gain access to the company&#39;s system. This can be done with exploits, zero-days (fresh vulnerabilities that have not been disclosed yet), physical attacks, malware, and other various means.</p>

<p>Once access has been gained, the next step is usually to seek escalation of privileges, also known as privesc. This process is mainly about getting root access, in order to gain full control of the target&#39;s system with no limitations.</p>

<p>Sometimes this won&#39;t be possible : a good middle ground is to gain admin or some other form of elevetaed access, in order to have less limitations to exploit your target.</p>

<h2>Clean-up</h2>

<p>This phase consists of keeping your target clean after exploitation: you will have to remove any exploits or uploaded files that you used in the company&#39;s system, and revert changes if you had to create users or edit configuration files.</p>

<p>This is a boring but crucial step, in order to ensure that the company&#39;s system is not left more damaged and vulnerable than it initially was.</p>

<h2>Reporting</h2>

<p>This last phase consists of documenting everything you&#39;ve found so the company can fix it. It should at least contain the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>A summary of objectives, goals and agreement followed by a general outline of your findings.</li>
<li>A summary of targeted systems and the methodology you used.</li>
<li>A description of the vulnerabilities you found and the results of your exploitation.</li>
<li>A guideline of possibles fixes and solutions for the vulnerabilities you found.</li>
</ul>

<p>The report is the only thing that will benefit the company from all of this: it should be as extensive and detailed as possible so they can eliminate or mitigate the vulnerabilities.</p>
