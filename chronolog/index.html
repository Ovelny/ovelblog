      <p>Chasm (my wiki) will be retiring soon. Maintaining my notes with Joplin has been way easier and I don't see any use for it at the moment.</p>

      <p>Like many people this weekend, I am incredibly frustrated by <a href=https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/10/2020-10-23-RIAA.md>youtube-dl's DMCA takedown</a>. It's how I use youtube daily and fetch content everywhere so I can study offline. Hope the project will continue to live on outside github.</p>

      <p>Excalidraw is a fantastic tool, too bad it's only a web or electron one. Still using it frequently as a poor man's whiteboard, which is great to retain what I'm learning: <a href=https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw>Excalidraw</a></p>

      <p>Just finished watching The Social Dilemma. While I didn't learn anything new, it did bring a few points under a new light for me. It also illustrates brilliantly why alternatives like mastodon do not solve most issues with social media. Might be worth a new post in the next few days?</p>

      <p>Stumbled on gtimelog, which seems to perfectly fit my needs for time tracking. It's not automatic, but the process is streamlined enough. Might use it over thyme:  https://github.com/gtimelog/gtimelog</p>

      <p>Taking a (hopefully big) hiatus from social medias. 2020 is already messy enough on its own and I can't manage to have a decent signal-to-noise ratio no matter the platform.</p>

      <p>Might get rid of the /TT page in the next few days, tracking time manually has proven to be more of a hassle than anything else. I now use thyme to do this automatically and locally, will add a tutorial on the wiki soon enough.</p>

      <p>This website has been completely rebuilt with nanoc, and features now a time tracking page (fetching the summary output of faereld) and a personal wiki. Also got entirely rid of JS!</p>

      <p>Making additional progress with the blog, mainly with the build process: I can now dump everything I write on dropbox paper right here, by automatically downloading all images and converting dropbox URLs to local ones. Neat.</p>

      <p>I finally took time to finish this blog, quite happy with the result! Efficient and minimalist, less than 100 LOCs for generating static pages with Flask. Some things are still WIP, but it's good enough to finally publish my things.</p>
