<p id="about">
  Hi! You've reached the blog of Thibault Vercout√®re, also known as ovelny. I like computers, music,
  cats, dogs, minimalism and sharing everything I learn. I'm also an ex system application
  administrator, currently learning penetration testing. I come from an unconventional
  background, something I've learned to be proud of.
